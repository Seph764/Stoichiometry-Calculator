# About
This software was originally intended for use in my own Chemistry 1 class back in high school. It has since then been developed into this project.

# Features
- Seamlessly calculate moles, grams, or grams per mole using the periodic table of elements.

# Installation
How to Use the Stoichiometry Calculator:

1. Make sure Python is installed and updated to the latest version. The installer can be downloaded from the python.org website.
2. Open and run the main file, labeled "stoichiometrycalculator.py". If a prompt appears asking what you would like to open it with, Right-Click > Open With > Python.
3. The program should now open in a command window. Follow the prompts carefully to use effectively.
4. Enjoy!
